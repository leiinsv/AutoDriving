TFBrain.py is the implementation of Deep Q-learning Network based on TensorFlow. 

1. It has both an MLP (multi-layer perception) implementation and a CNN (convolutional neural network) implementation 
The current implementation is a multi-layer perception network.
2. For the MLP implementation, Please refer to test_TFBrain.py for example of usage
3. For the CNN implementation, please refer to play_FlappyBird.py for example of usage

RoomEnv.py is only for the purpose of illustrating the usage of TFBrain.py

I did not write the code of FlappyBird game by myself. Instead, I copied the codes of the game from https://github.com/songrotek/DRL-FlappyBird, to use FlappyBird game as an case to test my implementation of CNN Q-learning network.
